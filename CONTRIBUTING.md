## üìã Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle errors gracefully

```javascript
// Good
function updateLogoPreview(config) {
    const logoElement = document.getElementById('logoSvg');
    // Update shape based on configuration
    updateShapeElement(logoElement, config.shape);
}

// Avoid
function update(c) {
    let e = document.getElementById('logoSvg');
    // complex logic without comments
}
```

### CSS
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Group related properties
- Use meaningful class names
- Prefer CSS variables for repeated values
- Mobile-first responsive design

```css
/* Good */
.template-item {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 12px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.template-item:hover {
    background-color: var(--hover-color);
    transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Maintain consistent indentation
- Use meaningful IDs and class names

```html
<!-- Good -->
<section class="template-section" aria-label="Logo Templates">
    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <div class="template-grid" role="grid">
        <button class="template-item" 
                onclick="applyTemplate('modern')" 
                aria-label="Apply modern template">
            <svg role="img" aria-hidden="true">...</svg>
